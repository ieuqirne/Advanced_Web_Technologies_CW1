# Advanced_Web_Technologies_CW1

The objective is to demonstrate your understanding of the Python Flask micro-framework by creating
a prototype web application for an online directory about a given subject. Your subject can be music,
movies, books, stars, butterflies, rabbits, or any other domain that interests you. If you have a novel
idea for a collection then speak to the module coordinator to make sure that it is suitable. You should
carefully consider the nature of the problem domain, and design a URL hierarchy that is appropriate for
finding and retrieving information about the collection. For example, when we think about a collection
of music we often consider genre and artist, but also other kinds of metadata like release dates, formats,
number of tracks, track length, album length, and many more parameters (it is worth looking at online
music streaming sites & MP3 management tools to get an idea of the ways that music can be organised
and discovered).
